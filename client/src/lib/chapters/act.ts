## What Is ACT?

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (pronounced "act," not A-C-T) is a mindfulness-based behavioral therapy that helps people accept what is outside their control while committing to actions that improve their lives.

ACT differs from some other approaches in an important way: the goal isn't to feel better—it's to get better at feeling. Rather than fighting against difficult emotions, ACT helps you make room for them while building a meaningful life.

### The Goal of ACT

**Psychological Flexibility:** The ability to be present, open up to difficult experiences, and take action guided by your values.

This involves:
- Being in the present moment
- Opening up to internal experiences (thoughts, feelings, sensations)
- Doing what matters based on your values

### Why ACT Works for Trauma

Trauma survivors often get caught in:
- Avoidance of painful memories and emotions
- Fusion with negative thoughts about self and world
- Disconnection from the present moment
- Loss of meaningful direction in life

ACT directly addresses each of these through its six core processes.

## The Six Core Processes

ACT is built around six interconnected processes that together create psychological flexibility.

### 1. Acceptance

**What It Is:**
Willingness to experience internal events (thoughts, feelings, memories, sensations) without trying to change, avoid, or control them.

**What It Isn't:**
- Liking or wanting the experience
- Resignation or giving up
- Enduring or tolerating
- Approving of what happened

**Why It Matters:**
Fighting against internal experiences often makes them worse and uses energy that could go toward living well. Acceptance creates space for experiences to be there while you focus on what matters.

**Practice:**
- Notice the urge to avoid or escape
- Breathe and make room for the experience
- Drop the struggle with the internal experience
- Allow it to be there without fighting

### 2. Cognitive Defusion

**What It Is:**
Stepping back from thoughts rather than being fused with them. Seeing thoughts as thoughts rather than as facts or commands.

**Fusion vs. Defusion:**
- **Fused:** "I am worthless" (the thought is experienced as a fact about you)
- **Defused:** "I'm having the thought that I am worthless" (the thought is recognized as a mental event)

**Why It Matters:**
When we're fused with thoughts, they control our behavior. When we're defused, we can notice thoughts without automatically acting on them or being overwhelmed by them.

**Techniques:**
- "I'm having the thought that..."
- Sing the thought to a silly tune
- Say it in a funny voice
- Thank your mind: "Thanks, mind, for that thought"
- See thoughts as leaves floating on a stream

### 3. Present Moment Awareness

**What It Is:**
Being here now, fully engaged with current experience rather than lost in the past or worried about the future.

**Why It Matters:**
Trauma often pulls us into the past (memories, flashbacks) or the future (fears, worries). The present is where life is actually happening and where we can take action.

**Practice:**
- Notice when you're lost in past or future
- Bring attention to current sensory experience
- Use the breath as an anchor
- Engage fully in whatever you're doing

### 4. Self-as-Context

**What It Is:**
Connecting with a sense of self that is larger than your thoughts, feelings, or experiences—the observing self that notices all experiences but is not any single one.

**The Observing Self:**
There's a part of you that has been present through all your experiences—watching, noticing. This "observer you" has been the same even as thoughts, feelings, and life circumstances have changed.

**Why It Matters:**
When you identify as the context (the observer) rather than the content (the thoughts and feelings), you become less threatened by difficult experiences. They're happening within you, but they're not you.

**Practice:**
- Notice that there's a "you" observing your experiences
- Recognize that you are the sky, not the weather
- Connect with continuity: "I am the same 'I' who has witnessed all my experiences"

### 5. Values

**What It Is:**
Clarifying what matters most to you—what kind of person you want to be and what you want your life to stand for.

**Values vs. Goals:**
- **Values:** Directions, like "North"—ongoing, never fully achieved
- **Goals:** Destinations—specific, achievable, completable

*Example:*
- Value: Being a loving parent
- Goals: Attend my child's recital, have dinner with family three times a week

**Why It Matters:**
Values provide direction and motivation. When life is painful, values give a reason to keep moving. Trauma can disconnect us from what matters; values reconnection restores meaning.

### 6. Committed Action

**What It Is:**
Taking concrete steps aligned with your values, even when it's hard, uncomfortable, or scary.

**Why It Matters:**
Insight and intention without action don't change your life. Committed action is where values become real.

**Practice:**
- Identify values-based actions
- Start small and build
- Expect obstacles and plan for them
- When you fall off, get back on

## The ACT Hexaflex

The six processes are often depicted as points on a hexagon (the "hexaflex"), all connecting to psychological flexibility at the center:

**The Hexaflex Model:**
- At the top: Present Moment Awareness
- Upper left: Acceptance
- Upper right: Cognitive Defusion
- At the center: Psychological Flexibility
- Lower left: Values
- Lower right: Self-as-Context
- At the bottom: Committed Action

All six processes interconnect and support each other, with psychological flexibility as the core outcome.

All processes work together. Weakness in one affects the others; strengthening one supports the rest.

## The ACT Matrix

The ACT Matrix is a simple tool for clarifying what matters and what gets in the way:

**Two Dimensions:**
1. Internal (thoughts, feelings) ↔ External (behavior, action)
2. Toward values (moving toward what matters) ↔ Away from pain (avoiding discomfort)

**Four Quadrants:**
- **Internal, toward:** What thoughts/feelings show up when moving toward values?
- **Internal, away:** What painful thoughts/feelings do you try to avoid?
- **External, toward:** What actions move you toward what matters?
- **External, away:** What do you do to avoid or escape pain?

**The Insight:**
We often spend more time in "away" moves (avoiding pain) than "toward" moves (approaching values). ACT helps shift toward values-based living.

Values are your heart's deepest desires for how you want to be in the world. They're not about what you think you should want or what others expect—they're about what genuinely matters to you.

## Understanding Values

### What Values Are

**Values Are:**
- Directions, like compass points
- Ongoing, never fully achieved
- About who you want to be
- Freely chosen by you
- Not dependent on outcomes
- Intrinsically rewarding

**Values Are Not:**
- Goals (which are achievable destinations)
- Feelings (values can guide action even when feelings are difficult)
- Moral rules imposed from outside
- Things you "should" care about
- Dependent on others' approval

### Values vs. Goals

**Values** are directions; **goals** are destinations on the path.

*Example:*
- **Value:** Being a supportive friend
- **Goals:** Call my friend this week, show up when they're struggling, remember their birthday

*Example:*
- **Value:** Continuous learning and growth
- **Goals:** Read one book a month, take a class this semester, ask for feedback at work

### Why Values Matter for Trauma Recovery

Trauma often disconnects us from what matters:
- Survival mode crowds out meaning
- Depression numbs desire
- Shame tells us we don't deserve good things
- Avoidance shrinks our lives

Reconnecting with values provides:
- Direction when life feels directionless
- Motivation when energy is low
- Meaning even in pain
- Reason to face difficult experiences

## Exploring Your Values

### Life Domains

Consider what matters to you in these areas:

**Family Relationships:**
What kind of family member do you want to be? What matters to you in your relationships with parents, siblings, children?

**Romantic Relationships:**
What kind of partner do you want to be? What matters to you in intimate relationships?

**Friendships:**
What kind of friend do you want to be? What do you value in friendship?

**Work/Career:**
What matters to you in your work? What kind of colleague, employee, or professional do you want to be?

**Education/Learning:**
How important is learning and growth to you? What do you want to learn about or develop?

**Recreation/Hobbies:**
What do you enjoy doing? What brings you pleasure, fun, creativity?

**Spirituality:**
What are your spiritual or religious values? What gives you a sense of meaning or connection to something larger?

**Community/Citizenship:**
How do you want to contribute to your community or the world?

**Health/Wellbeing:**
How do you want to care for your body and mind? What matters to you about health?

**Environment/Nature:**
How do you want to relate to the natural world?

### Clarifying Questions

Ask yourself:
- If I had no fear, how would I spend my time?
- What do I want my life to stand for?
- What qualities do I most admire in others?
- At the end of my life, what will have mattered?
- When have I felt most alive, most like myself?
- What would I regret not pursuing?
- If I could be any kind of person, who would I be?

### Values Identification Exercise

For each life domain, ask:
1. Is this area important to me? (Some domains may not be)
2. What qualities do I want to embody in this area?
3. How am I currently living (or not living) these values?
4. What would I be doing differently if I fully lived this value?

## Writing Values Statements

Turn your values into clear, personal statements:

**Template:**
"I value [quality] in [area], which means [how it shows up]."

**Examples:**
- "I value being a present, loving parent, which means putting down my phone when my kids talk to me and making time for what matters to them."
- "I value honesty in my relationships, which means speaking my truth even when it's uncomfortable and not pretending to be someone I'm not."
- "I value continuous learning, which means staying curious, reading widely, and being willing to be wrong."

## Living Your Values

### Small Steps

Values are lived through action. Start small:
- What would someone who holds this value do today?
- What's one small step toward this value?
- What could I do in the next hour?

### Values-Based Action Planning

For each important value:
1. Identify 2-3 specific goals that express this value
2. Break goals into concrete actions
3. Schedule specific actions
4. Anticipate obstacles and plan how to handle them
5. Notice when you're acting on values (and celebrate)

### When Values Conflict

Sometimes values pull in different directions:
- Career success vs. family time
- Authenticity vs. harmony
- Self-care vs. service to others

**Strategies:**
- Clarify what matters most right now
- Look for creative solutions that honor both
- Accept that some tension is normal
- Make conscious choices rather than avoiding the conflict

### Bringing Values to Difficult Situations

Ask: "How can I bring my values to this difficult situation?"

Even in pain, you can:
- Be kind to yourself (if self-compassion is a value)
- Be honest about your experience (if authenticity is a value)
- Stay connected to loved ones (if relationships are a value)
- Learn and grow from the experience (if growth is a value)

Defusion helps you step back from thoughts so they have less power over your behavior and wellbeing. Instead of being caught up in thoughts, you observe them from a distance.

## Understanding Fusion

### What Is Fusion?

When we're "fused" with thoughts:
- We believe thoughts are literally true
- We take thoughts very seriously
- We let thoughts dictate our actions
- We see thoughts as commands or threats
- We can't separate ourselves from our thoughts

**Fusion example:**
The thought "I'm worthless" is experienced as a fact about who you are. You feel crushed by it, and it controls your behavior.

### What Is Defusion?

When we're "defused" from thoughts:
- We see thoughts as mental events, not facts
- We can notice thoughts without buying into them
- Thoughts have less power over our behavior
- We can choose how to respond to thoughts
- We create space between ourselves and our thoughts

**Defusion example:**
The thought "I'm worthless" is noticed as a thought. You observe it with curiosity: "Interesting—there's that thought again." It's present, but it doesn't control you.

## Defusion Techniques

### "I'm Having the Thought That..."

Preface negative thoughts with this phrase:

**Instead of:** "I'm a failure."
**Try:** "I'm having the thought that I'm a failure."

**Instead of:** "I'll never get better."
**Try:** "I'm having the thought that I'll never get better."

**Why it works:** This simple addition creates distance. The thought is now something you're experiencing, not a fact about reality.

### Adding "My Mind Is Telling Me..."

Similar to above:

**Instead of:** "No one likes me."
**Try:** "My mind is telling me that no one likes me."

This externalizes the thought—it's your mind producing a thought, not truth being revealed.

### Singing Thoughts

Take a negative thought and sing it to a silly tune:
- "Happy Birthday"
- A nursery rhyme
- Your favorite pop song

*Example:* Sing "I'm such a loser" to the tune of "Happy Birthday."

**Why it works:** It's hard to take a thought seriously when it's set to a ridiculous tune. This changes your relationship to the thought.

### Funny Voices

Say the thought in a silly voice:
- Cartoon character
- Helium voice
- Slow motion
- Movie villain

**Why it works:** Like singing, this makes it harder to take the thought so seriously.

### Thanking Your Mind

When a negative thought arises, respond with:
- "Thanks, mind, for that thought!"
- "Thanks for sharing, mind."
- "That's an interesting one. Thanks, mind."

**Why it works:** This acknowledges the thought without getting caught up in it. It's polite dismissal.

### Leaves on a Stream

Visualization practice:

1. Close your eyes and imagine sitting by a gentle stream
2. Leaves are floating by on the water
3. Each time a thought arises, place it on a leaf
4. Watch the leaf drift downstream and out of sight
5. If you get caught up in thoughts, notice that, and return to the stream
6. Continue for 5-10 minutes

**Why it works:** This creates a visual representation of thoughts coming and going, reinforcing that thoughts are temporary and you don't have to hold onto them.

### Computer Pop-Ups

Imagine thoughts as annoying pop-up ads on a computer:
- They appear unbidden
- You don't have to click on them
- You can close them and continue what you're doing
- They'll probably pop up again
- You can close them again

**Why it works:** This normalizes intrusive thoughts and emphasizes choice about engagement.

### Naming the Story

Recognize recurring thought patterns as "stories" your mind tells:

"Ah, there's the 'I'm not good enough' story again."
"My mind is playing the 'I'll never recover' story."
"There's that old 'everyone abandons me eventually' story."

**Why it works:** Naming the story creates distance and helps you recognize patterns. A story is something you observe, not something you are.

### Giving Your Inner Critic a Name

Give your critical inner voice a name (make it silly or neutral):

"There goes Charlie again with the criticism."
"Debbie Downer is at it again."

**Why it works:** Externalizing the critic makes it feel less like essential truth and more like an annoying character in your head.

### Radio Station Metaphor

Imagine your mind as a radio station—"Radio Doom and Gloom" or "KFEAR."

"My mind radio is playing its greatest hits again."

You don't have to believe or act on what the radio plays. It's just broadcasting; you can let it play in the background.

### Asking "Is This Thought Helpful?"

When a thought arises, ask:
- Is this thought helpful right now?
- Does believing this thought serve my values?
- Is this thought taking me toward or away from the life I want?

**Note:** This isn't about whether the thought is true—it's about whether engaging with it helps you.

## The Goal of Defusion

Defusion is **NOT** about:
- Getting rid of thoughts
- Making thoughts go away
- Replacing negative thoughts with positive ones
- Pretending you don't have these thoughts

Defusion **IS** about:
- Changing your relationship to thoughts
- Creating distance
- Reducing the power thoughts have over you
- Choosing whether and how to respond to thoughts
- Acting on your values regardless of what your mind says

## Practice

**Start small:**
Practice defusion with minor bothersome thoughts before tackling major ones.

**Practice regularly:**
Daily practice builds the skill so it's available when you need it.

**Be patient:**
This is a different way of relating to thoughts. It takes time to develop.

**Notice what works:**
Different techniques work for different people. Find what helps you.
