## What Is DBT?

Dialectical Behavior Therapy was developed by Dr. Marsha Linehan initially for borderline personality disorder but has proven effective for many conditions, especially those involving emotional dysregulation and trauma.

DBT is particularly valuable for trauma survivors because it:
- Addresses emotional intensity common in trauma
- Teaches specific skills for managing overwhelming feelings
- Balances acceptance and change
- Provides crisis survival strategies

\`\`\`chart:DBTSkillsChart\`\`\`

### The Dialectical Philosophy

"Dialectical" means working with opposites. The core dialectic in DBT is:

**Acceptance AND Change**

- You can accept yourself as you are AND work on changing
- Your experience is valid AND you can develop new skills
- Life is painful AND worth living
- You're doing your best AND you can do better

This "both/and" approach differs from "either/or" thinking that often accompanies trauma.

### The Four Skill Modules

DBT teaches skills in four areas:
1. **Mindfulness:** Core skill underlying all others
2. **Distress Tolerance:** Surviving crises without making things worse
3. **Emotion Regulation:** Understanding and managing emotions
4. **Interpersonal Effectiveness:** Maintaining relationships and self-respect

## Mindfulness Skills

Mindfulness is the foundation of DBT. It involves being present with full awareness, without judgment.

### "What" Skills

These describe what you do when practicing mindfulness:

**Observe:**
Notice your experience without adding or subtracting anything. Just notice.
- Watch thoughts come and go
- Notice sensations in your body
- Observe emotions rising and falling
- Notice urges without acting

**Describe:**
Put your experience into words, sticking to the facts.
- "I notice I'm feeling anxious"
- "My heart is beating faster"
- "I'm having the thought that..."
- Keep it factual, not interpretive

**Participate:**
Fully engage in the present moment without self-consciousness.
- Become one with what you're doing
- Let go of rumination and worry
- Be fully present

### "How" Skills

These describe how you practice mindfulness:

**Non-judgmentally:**
Observe without evaluating as good or bad.
- Replace "good/bad" with "helpful/unhelpful"
- Notice when judgments arise
- Let go of judgments
- Focus on facts

**One-mindfully:**
Do one thing at a time with full attention.
- When eating, just eat
- When listening, just listen
- When walking, just walk
- Bring attention back when it wanders

**Effectively:**
Do what works in this situation, not what "should" work.
- Focus on goals
- Let go of being "right"
- Play by the rules of the situation
- Be skillful

### Wise Mind

DBT describes three states of mind:

**Reasonable Mind:**
Cool, logical, task-focused. Based on facts and thinking.

**Emotion Mind:**
Hot, mood-driven, reactive. Based on feelings and urges.

**Wise Mind:**
The synthesis—where reason and emotion overlap. Intuitive knowing that integrates both.

Accessing Wise Mind:
- Pause and breathe
- Ask: "What does my wise mind say?"
- Listen to the quiet inner voice
- Notice what you know deep down

## Distress Tolerance Skills

These skills help you survive emotional crises without making things worse.

### TIPP Skills

For immediate, intense distress:

**Temperature:**
Change your body temperature to change your emotion.
- Hold ice cubes
- Splash cold water on face
- Take a cold shower
- Activates dive reflex, slowing heart rate

**Intense Exercise:**
Brief, intense physical activity.
- Jumping jacks, running in place
- Pushups or burpees
- Any vigorous movement
- Burns off stress hormones

**Paced Breathing:**
Slow your breathing, especially exhales.
- Breathe in for 4 counts
- Breathe out for 6-8 counts
- Longer exhale activates relaxation response
- Continue for several minutes

**Paired Muscle Relaxation:**
Tense and release muscle groups.
- Tense muscles while breathing in
- Say "relax" while releasing and breathing out
- Move through body systematically

### STOP Skill

When emotions are overwhelming:

**S - Stop:**
Don't react immediately. Freeze in place.

**T - Take a Step Back:**
Create physical and mental space. Breathe.

**O - Observe:**
Notice what's happening inside and outside you.

**P - Proceed Mindfully:**
Consider options. Choose wisely based on goals.

### Distraction (ACCEPTS)

Healthy distraction when you can't solve the problem:

**A - Activities:**
Engage in activities that require attention.

**C - Contributing:**
Help others. Get outside yourself.

**C - Comparisons:**
Compare to times you've coped. Compare to others who have it harder (carefully).

**E - Emotions:**
Create different emotions. Watch something funny or uplifting.

**P - Pushing Away:**
Mentally put the situation aside temporarily.

**T - Thoughts:**
Replace distressing thoughts with neutral ones. Count, do puzzles.

**S - Sensations:**
Create strong physical sensations. Hold ice, eat something sour.

### Radical Acceptance

Accepting reality as it is, even when painful.

**What It Is:**
- Fully accepting the facts of reality
- Letting go of fighting against what is
- Acknowledging that this is how things are right now
- Choosing not to add suffering to pain

**What It Isn't:**
- Approval or liking
- Giving up on change
- Forgiveness (though it can lead there)
- Weakness or defeat

**How to Practice:**
- Observe that you're fighting reality
- Remind yourself that reality is what it is
- Consider the causes of this moment
- Practice accepting with your whole self (mind, body, actions)
- Turn the mind toward acceptance again and again

### Self-Soothing

Comfort yourself through your senses:

**Vision:** Look at beautiful things—nature, art, photos
**Hearing:** Listen to soothing music, nature sounds
**Smell:** Use favorite scents, candles, essential oils
**Taste:** Enjoy a comforting food or drink mindfully
**Touch:** Use soft textures, warm baths, comfortable clothes

## Emotion Regulation Skills

Understanding and managing your emotional experiences.

### Understanding Emotions

**The Function of Emotions:**
All emotions serve a purpose:
- **Fear:** Protects from danger
- **Anger:** Signals boundary violations
- **Sadness:** Processes loss
- **Shame:** Maintains social bonds
- **Joy:** Reinforces what's good

**The Emotion Wave:**
Emotions naturally rise, peak, and fall. If we ride the wave without acting impulsively, emotions will pass.

### ABC PLEASE

**Accumulate Positive Experiences:**
- Short-term: Do pleasant things daily
- Long-term: Build a life worth living based on values

**Build Mastery:**
- Do challenging things that create competence
- Set achievable goals and meet them
- Increase self-efficacy

**Cope Ahead:**
- Anticipate difficult situations
- Plan how you'll cope
- Rehearse in your mind

**Treat Physical Illness**
**Balance Eating**
**Avoid Mood-Altering Substances**
**Balance Sleep**
**Get Exercise**

Taking care of your body reduces emotional vulnerability.

### Check the Facts

Before acting on emotions, check if your perception matches reality:
1. What emotion am I feeling?
2. What event triggered the emotion?
3. What are my interpretations and assumptions?
4. Am I assuming the worst?
5. Does my emotion's intensity fit the facts?
6. What's the most effective response?

### Opposite Action

When emotions don't fit the facts or aren't effective, act opposite to the urge:

**Fear (when not in danger):**
- Urge: Avoid
- Opposite: Approach

**Sadness (when action would help):**
- Urge: Withdraw
- Opposite: Get active, engage

**Anger (when attacking would make things worse):**
- Urge: Attack
- Opposite: Be gentle, take space

**Shame (when undeserved):**
- Urge: Hide
- Opposite: Make public, share

Emotion regulation skills help you understand, manage, and change your emotional experiences. These skills are especially valuable for trauma survivors who often experience intense, overwhelming emotions.

## Understanding Emotions

### Why Emotions Matter

Emotions are not the enemy—they serve important functions:

**Fear** motivates us to escape danger
**Anger** energizes us to overcome obstacles
**Sadness** signals loss and elicits support
**Joy** reinforces what's good
**Shame** maintains social bonds
**Guilt** motivates repair after wrongdoing

**The problem isn't emotions—it's:**
- Emotions that don't fit facts
- Intensity that doesn't match the situation
- Acting on emotions in ineffective ways
- Trying to suppress or avoid emotions

### The Model of Emotions

**Prompting Event:**
Something happens internally or externally.

**Interpretation:**
You interpret the event based on beliefs, expectations, and history.

**Emotional Response:**
The emotion arises with:
- Subjective feeling
- Physiological changes
- Urges to act
- Facial expression and body language

**Aftereffects:**
The emotion influences subsequent thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.

### The Emotion Wave

All emotions naturally rise, peak, and fall—like waves. If we don't feed them or fight them, they will pass.

**Feeding emotions:** Ruminating, adding more thoughts, acting on urges
**Fighting emotions:** Suppressing, denying, judging ourselves for having them

**Riding the wave:** Observing, allowing, letting it pass naturally

## Changing Emotional Responses

### Check the Facts

When emotions arise, check if your perception matches reality:

**Step 1:** What emotion am I feeling?
Name it specifically.

**Step 2:** What event triggered the emotion?
Describe facts, not interpretations.

**Step 3:** What are my interpretations?
What am I assuming? What meaning am I making?

**Step 4:** Am I assuming threat?
Am I expecting the worst? Is there another explanation?

**Step 5:** What's the probability?
How likely is my fear actually coming true?

**Step 6:** What are the actual consequences?
Even if my fear comes true, what would really happen? Could I cope?

**Step 7:** Does my emotion fit the facts?
Is this emotion justified by the actual situation?

**Step 8:** What's effective?
What response would serve my goals?

### Opposite Action

When emotions don't fit facts or acting on them would be ineffective, act opposite to the urge.

**Fear (when not in danger):**
- Urge: Avoid, escape, hide
- Opposite: Approach what you fear
- Do it repeatedly until fear decreases

**Anger (when unjustified or action unhelpful):**
- Urge: Attack, criticize, be aggressive
- Opposite: Be gentle, take space, find empathy
- Avoid the person, gently

**Sadness (when action would help):**
- Urge: Withdraw, isolate, stay inactive
- Opposite: Get active, approach people
- Do opposite of urges

**Shame (when unjustified):**
- Urge: Hide, avoid, keep secret
- Opposite: Share with trusted others
- Be public about what you're ashamed of
- Repeat behavior if not actually harmful

**Guilt (when unjustified or action unhelpful):**
- When unjustified: Opposite action (don't apologize, don't try to repair)
- When justified: Make amends, problem-solve, accept consequences

### Problem Solving

When emotions are justified and action can help:

1. **Define the problem** clearly
2. **Check the facts** of the situation
3. **Identify your goal**
4. **Brainstorm solutions** (lots of options)
5. **Evaluate solutions** (pros and cons)
6. **Choose a solution** and commit
7. **Act on the solution**
8. **Evaluate the results**

## Letting Go of Emotional Suffering

### Mindfulness of Current Emotion

Instead of fighting or feeding emotions:

1. **Observe** the emotion without judgment
2. **Describe** what you notice
3. **Allow** the emotion to be present
4. **Don't judge** yourself for having it
5. **Don't try to** get rid of it or keep it
6. **Remember** it will pass

### Riding the Wave

Practice letting emotions rise, peak, and fall:

- Notice when the emotion begins
- Observe it building
- Experience the peak
- Watch it begin to subside
- Let it pass naturally
