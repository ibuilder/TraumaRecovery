## History and Development of DBT

### Origins: Dr. Marsha Linehan

Dialectical Behavior Therapy was developed in the late 1980s by Dr. Marsha Linehan, a psychologist at the University of Washington. The development of DBT is remarkable because Dr. Linehan herself was a former psychiatric patient who had been hospitalized for severe mental health issues as a young woman.

**The Problem DBT Solved:**

In the 1970s-80s, standard cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) wasn't working well for clients with severe emotional dysregulation, particularly those with borderline personality disorder (BPD). These clients:
- Felt invalidated by the focus on change
- Dropped out of treatment frequently
- Didn't respond to standard interventions
- Often engaged in self-harm and suicidal behavior

**Linehan's Insight:**

Dr. Linehan realized that pure focus on change made clients feel criticized and invalidated. They needed acceptance first. But pure acceptance without change meant they stayed stuck. The solution was dialectical—both acceptance AND change.

### The Biosocial Theory

DBT is based on the biosocial theory of emotional dysregulation:

**Biological Vulnerability:**
Some people are born with nervous systems that:
- React more quickly to emotional stimuli
- React more intensely
- Take longer to return to baseline

**Invalidating Environment:**
When emotionally sensitive people grow up in environments that:
- Dismiss or punish emotional expression
- Tell them their feelings are wrong or "too much"
- Expect them to regulate emotions they can't yet control
- Fail to teach emotional skills

**The Result:**
The combination creates severe emotional dysregulation:
- Intense, rapidly shifting emotions
- Inability to manage emotional responses
- Impulsive behaviors to escape emotional pain
- Unstable sense of self and relationships

### Evidence Base

DBT is one of the most researched psychotherapies:

- **Over 50 randomized controlled trials** support its effectiveness
- **FDA-recognized** for borderline personality disorder
- **Effective for:** BPD, suicidal behavior, self-harm, substance abuse, eating disorders, depression, PTSD, and more
- **Consistently reduces:** Hospitalizations, suicidal behavior, treatment dropout

## The Logic of DBT: Dialectical Philosophy

### What "Dialectical" Means

"Dialectical" comes from dialectics—a form of philosophical reasoning involving the synthesis of opposites.

**Thesis + Antithesis = Synthesis**

In DBT, the core dialectic is:

> **Acceptance** + **Change** = **Transformation**

You are acceptable as you are AND you can change. Both are true simultaneously.

### The Core Dialectic: Acceptance and Change

**The Acceptance Side:**
- Validation of your experience
- Mindfulness skills
- Distress tolerance skills
- Radical acceptance
- "You're doing the best you can"

**The Change Side:**
- Learning new skills
- Emotion regulation
- Interpersonal effectiveness
- Problem-solving
- "You need to do better"

**The Synthesis:**
"You're doing the best you can AND you need to do better, try harder, and be more motivated to change."

This paradox is at the heart of DBT.

### Why Dialectics Matter

**Either/Or Thinking (Non-Dialectical):**
- "Either I'm totally good or totally bad"
- "Either this situation is acceptable or unacceptable"
- "Either I accept myself or I change"
- This black-and-white thinking creates suffering

**Both/And Thinking (Dialectical):**
- "I am both flawed AND worthy of love"
- "This situation is both painful AND survivable"
- "I can accept myself AND work on growing"
- This synthesis creates freedom

### Walking the Middle Path

DBT teaches finding balance between extremes:

| One Extreme | Middle Path | Other Extreme |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| All emotion | Wise Mind | All logic |
| Total acceptance | Radical acceptance + problem-solving | Fighting reality |
| Never asking for help | Effective help-seeking | Always depending on others |
| Rigid rules | Flexibility with structure | Chaos |
| Self-denial | Self-care + consideration of others | Selfishness |

## The Four Skill Modules Overview

DBT teaches skills in four interconnected areas:

### 1. Mindfulness (Core Skill)
The foundation of all other skills. Being present, aware, and non-judgmental.

### 2. Distress Tolerance
Surviving crises without making things worse. Getting through unbearable moments.

### 3. Emotion Regulation
Understanding, managing, and changing emotional experiences.

### 4. Interpersonal Effectiveness
Maintaining relationships, getting needs met, and keeping self-respect.

      content: `# Mindfulness: The Core Skill of DBT

Mindfulness is the foundation upon which all other DBT skills are built. It is the practice of paying attention, on purpose, to the present moment, without judgment.

## What Is Mindfulness?

### Definition

Mindfulness involves:
- **Awareness** of the present moment
- **Attention** focused intentionally
- **Acceptance** of what is, without judgment
- **Observation** of experience without reactivity

### The Importance of Mindfulness in DBT

Mindfulness is called the "core" skill because:
- It underlies all other skill modules
- Without awareness, you can't use other skills
- It creates space between stimulus and response
- It allows you to notice emotions before acting on them
- It is the gateway to Wise Mind

### Mindfulness in Daily Life

Mindfulness isn't just meditation—it's a way of living:
- Being fully present when eating, walking, talking
- Noticing your experience moment to moment
- Observing thoughts and feelings as they arise
- Engaging fully in whatever you're doing

## The "What" Skills

The "What" skills describe WHAT you do when practicing mindfulness:

### Observe

**The Skill:**
Simply notice your experience. Don't add anything; don't take anything away. Just observe.

**What to Observe:**
- Physical sensations in your body
- Thoughts passing through your mind
- Emotions arising and falling
- Urges and impulses
- What you see, hear, smell, taste, touch

**How to Practice:**
- Notice your breath without changing it
- Watch thoughts like clouds passing by
- Feel your feet on the ground
- Listen to sounds around you
- Notice temperature on your skin

**Key Points:**
- Don't try to change what you observe
- Step back and watch, as if from a distance
- Be like a camera, just recording
- Let go of words and analysis—just notice

**Practice Exercise:**
Sit quietly for 5 minutes. Simply observe whatever arises—thoughts, sensations, sounds. Each time you notice you're caught in thinking, gently return to just observing.

---

### Describe

**The Skill:**
Put your observations into words. Describe the facts of your experience.

**How to Describe:**
- Stick to the facts
- Use descriptive words, not evaluative ones
- "I notice I'm feeling anxious" (not "I'm a mess")
- "My heart is beating fast" (not "I'm dying")
- "I'm having the thought that..." (not "I know for sure...")

**Describing vs. Judging:**

| Describing | Judging |
|-----------|---------|
| "I feel sad" | "I'm pathetic" |
| "My stomach is tight" | "I'm freaking out" |
| "I'm having thoughts about failure" | "I'm a failure" |
| "She raised her voice" | "She was attacking me" |

**Key Points:**
- Describe only what you can directly observe
- Don't confuse observations with interpretations
- Use "I notice..." or "I'm having the thought that..."
- Describing thoughts creates distance from them

**Practice Exercise:**
For 5 minutes, describe your experience aloud or in writing. "I notice tension in my shoulders. I hear birds outside. I'm having the thought that I should be doing something else. I feel cool air on my skin."

---

### Participate

**The Skill:**
Throw yourself fully into the present moment. Become one with your activity.

**What Participation Looks Like:**
- Dancing without self-consciousness
- Having a conversation with full attention
- Cooking while fully engaged with the process
- Playing a sport with complete focus
- Being totally present with another person

**How to Practice:**
- Let go of self-consciousness
- Stop observing yourself from outside
- Become absorbed in what you're doing
- Act intuitively and spontaneously
- Be fully present

**Key Points:**
- This is the opposite of dissociation
- You lose yourself in the activity
- No sense of separation between you and the experience
- Often called "flow" states
- Practice builds capacity for presence

**Practice Exercise:**
Choose an activity you enjoy. For 15 minutes, engage with it fully—no phone, no multitasking, no self-monitoring. Just do the activity completely.

## The "How" Skills

The "How" skills describe HOW you practice mindfulness:

### Non-Judgmentally

**The Skill:**
Observe and describe without evaluating as "good" or "bad."

**What Non-Judgment Looks Like:**
- Noticing an emotion without calling it wrong
- Observing a thought without labeling it stupid
- Experiencing a situation without deciding it "shouldn't" be this way
- Letting go of "should" and "shouldn't"

**Judgments vs. Descriptions:**

| Judgment | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| "This is terrible" | "This is painful" |
| "I shouldn't feel this way" | "I notice I'm feeling this way" |
| "She's awful" | "She did that behavior" |
| "I'm so stupid" | "I made a mistake" |

**Acknowledging Preferences:**
Non-judgment doesn't mean no preferences:
- "I don't like this" is fine
- "This is bad/wrong" is a judgment

**When You Notice Judgments:**
- Don't judge your judging!
- Simply notice: "I'm having a judgment"
- Gently return to describing

**Practice Exercise:**
For one hour, notice every time you make a judgment (good/bad, right/wrong, should/shouldn't). Don't try to stop—just notice. Count them if you like.

---

### One-Mindfully

**The Skill:**
Do one thing at a time with full attention.

**What One-Mindfulness Looks Like:**
- When eating, just eat
- When walking, just walk
- When listening, just listen
- When thinking, just think
- Being fully where you are

**The Opposite of One-Mindfulness:**
- Eating while watching TV and checking phone
- Having a conversation while planning what you'll say
- Doing one thing while thinking about ten others
- Never being fully anywhere

**How to Practice:**
- Choose to do one thing
- Give it your full attention
- When attention wanders, return
- Complete one task before starting another
- Be where you are, not somewhere else

**Practice Exercise:**
Eat one meal with no distractions—no phone, no TV, no reading. Just eat. Notice the food, the sensations, the experience of eating.

---

### Effectively

**The Skill:**
Do what works in this situation. Focus on goals, not on being "right."

**What Effectiveness Looks Like:**
- Choosing the response that achieves your goals
- Letting go of the need to be "right"
- Playing by the rules of the game (even when you don't like them)
- Being skillful rather than willful
- Doing what the situation requires

**Effectiveness vs. Willfulness:**

| Effective | Willful |
|-----------|---------|
| "What will work here?" | "What should work" |
| Playing by actual rules | Insisting rules should be different |
| Doing what helps | Doing what feels right in the moment |
| Choosing battles wisely | Fighting every battle |

**Key Points:**
- The goal is to be effective, not to be right
- Sometimes effectiveness means compromise
- Consider consequences, not just principles
- Don't cut off your nose to spite your face

**Practice Exercise:**
Think of a current interpersonal conflict. Ask: "What do I actually want here? What response would get me closer to that goal, even if it feels uncomfortable?"

## Deep Dive: Advanced Mindfulness

### The Challenge of Mindfulness for Trauma Survivors

Mindfulness can be challenging for trauma survivors:
- Turning inward can trigger traumatic memories
- Body awareness may be frightening
- Stillness may feel vulnerable
- Present-moment awareness may be painful

**Modifications for Trauma:**
- Keep eyes open if closing them is triggering
- Use grounding objects during practice
- Start with external focus (sounds, sights) before internal
- Practice for shorter periods
- Always feel free to stop
- Work with a trauma-informed therapist

### Informal Mindfulness Practice

Mindfulness doesn't require sitting still:

**Mindful Walking:**
Feel each step. Notice your feet touching the ground, your weight shifting, your body moving through space.

**Mindful Eating:**
Slow down. Notice colors, textures, smells, tastes. Chew thoroughly. Put down utensils between bites.

**Mindful Listening:**
Give full attention to another person. Don't plan your response. Just listen.

**Mindful Breathing:**
Throughout the day, take three conscious breaths. Feel them fully.

**Mindful Transitions:**
Between activities, pause. Take a breath. Arrive in the new moment.

### The Neuroscience of Mindfulness

Research shows mindfulness practice:
- Increases prefrontal cortex activity (executive function)
- Decreases amygdala reactivity (emotional reactions)
- Improves connectivity between brain regions
- Increases gray matter in regions related to learning, memory, and emotion regulation
- Reduces stress hormones (cortisol)
- Improves immune function

### Building a Mindfulness Practice

**Start Small:**
- Begin with 5 minutes daily
- Consistency matters more than duration
- Build gradually over time

**Choose Your Practice:**
- Formal sitting meditation
- Walking meditation
- Body scan
- Mindful activities
- App-guided practice

**Overcome Obstacles:**
- "I can't quiet my mind" — You're not supposed to; just notice thoughts
- "I don't have time" — Start with 2 minutes
- "I keep forgetting" — Link to existing habit
- "It's boring" — Notice even that experience

Wise Mind is one of the most important concepts in DBT. It represents the integration of emotion and reason—the inner wisdom that combines heart and head.

## The Three States of Mind

DBT describes three states of mind:

### Reasonable Mind

**Characteristics:**
- Cool, logical, task-focused
- Based on facts and thinking
- Analytical and rational
- Disconnected from emotions
- Problem-solving oriented

**When Reasonable Mind is Helpful:**
- Solving logical problems
- Planning and organizing
- Analyzing data
- Making practical decisions
- When emotions would interfere

**When Reasonable Mind is Limiting:**
- Ignoring important emotional information
- Making decisions that "make sense" but feel wrong
- Being cold or distant in relationships
- Missing intuitive wisdom
- Treating everything as a problem to solve

**Example:**
Reasonable Mind says: "Statistically, this relationship has a low probability of success. I should end it." (Ignoring love, history, connection)

---

### Emotion Mind

**Characteristics:**
- Hot, mood-driven, reactive
- Based on feelings and urges
- Passionate and intense
- Facts and logic take a back seat
- Impulsive action-oriented

**When Emotion Mind is Helpful:**
- Creative expression
- Passionate advocacy
- Deep connection with others
- Responding to genuine emergencies
- Experiencing joy and love fully

**When Emotion Mind is Limiting:**
- Making impulsive decisions you regret
- Reacting without thinking
- Distorting facts to match feelings
- Damaging relationships in anger
- Believing feelings are facts

**Example:**
Emotion Mind says: "I'm so angry I could scream. I need to tell them exactly what I think right now!" (Ignoring consequences)

---

### Wise Mind

**Characteristics:**
- The synthesis of reason and emotion
- Integration of head and heart
- Intuitive knowing
- Considers both facts and feelings
- Calm inner wisdom

**Accessing Wise Mind:**
Wise Mind is where reason and emotion overlap. It's not:
- Just thinking logically about feelings
- Just feeling deeply while ignoring facts
- Alternating between the two

It's an integration—a "third thing" that emerges when both are honored.

**What Wise Mind Feels Like:**
- A sense of "knowing"
- Calm clarity
- Feeling centered
- Intuitive understanding
- "This is the right thing"
- Peace with the decision

## Finding Your Wise Mind

### The Stone on the Lake

**Visualization:**
Imagine your mind is a beautiful lake. The surface is choppy with thoughts and emotions—this is where Reasonable Mind and Emotion Mind live.

Now imagine a small stone dropping from the surface. Watch it drift down... down... down... past the choppy surface, through the moving water, until it settles at the very bottom.

At the bottom, the water is still and clear. This is Wise Mind—always there, beneath the surface activity.

**Practice:**
When seeking Wise Mind:
1. Close your eyes
2. Imagine the stone dropping
3. Follow it down
4. Rest at the bottom
5. Ask your question from this place
6. Listen for the quiet answer

### Wise Mind Questions

When you need guidance, ask:
- "What does my Wise Mind say about this?"
- "What do I know deep down?"
- "If I could step back from my emotions and thoughts, what would I see?"
- "What would a wise person I respect suggest?"
- "What would I tell a friend in this situation?"

### Wise Mind vs. Wishful Thinking

**Wise Mind:**
- Considers all the facts
- Acknowledges emotions
- Feels centered and calm
- Often requires courage to follow
- Aligned with values

**Wishful Thinking:**
- Ignores inconvenient facts
- Driven by desire or fear
- Feels agitated or desperate
- Is the "easy" path
- May conflict with values

**Test:**
"Does this decision require me to ignore important information or dismiss valid concerns?" If yes, it may be wishful thinking, not Wise Mind.

### Barriers to Wise Mind

**Extreme Emotion:**
When emotions are very intense, Wise Mind is hard to access. Use distress tolerance skills first, then return.

**Overthinking:**
Excessive analysis can drown out intuition. Sometimes you need to stop thinking and just feel/know.

**Disconnection from Self:**
Trauma can disconnect us from inner wisdom. Practice may be needed to rebuild this connection.

**Fear:**
Sometimes we know the wise answer but fear following it. Wise Mind takes courage.

## Wise Mind in Daily Life

### Making Decisions

**The Wise Mind Decision Process:**
1. Gather the facts (Reasonable Mind)
2. Notice your emotions about the situation (Emotion Mind)
3. Pause and center yourself
4. Ask: "What does Wise Mind say?"
5. Listen for the quiet answer
6. Consider: Does this feel centered and true?
7. Act on Wise Mind's guidance

### In Relationships

Wise Mind helps navigate relationships:
- Speaking truthfully but with compassion
- Setting boundaries while maintaining connection
- Knowing when to compromise and when to hold firm
- Responding to conflict with clarity

### In Crisis

During crisis, Wise Mind may be hard to reach:
- First, use distress tolerance skills
- Reduce emotional intensity
- Ground yourself
- Then ask: "What is the wise response?"
- Trust that Wise Mind is always there, even when temporarily inaccessible

## Developing Wise Mind

### Daily Practice

**Morning Wise Mind Check-In:**
Before starting your day:
- Take three deep breaths
- Ask: "What does my Wise Mind want me to know today?"
- Listen
- Set an intention based on what you hear

**Wise Mind Pause:**
Throughout the day, especially before important decisions:
- Stop
- Breathe
- Drop into Wise Mind
- Act from that place

**Evening Reflection:**
Before sleep:
- Review the day
- Notice times you were in Wise Mind vs. Reasonable or Emotion Mind
- No judgment—just observation
- Celebrate Wise Mind moments

### Strengthening the Connection

**Meditation:**
Regular meditation practice strengthens access to Wise Mind.

**Journaling:**
Write from Wise Mind. Ask questions and let answers emerge.

**Body Awareness:**
Wise Mind often communicates through the body. Notice physical sensations when accessing it.

**Practice:**
Like any skill, Wise Mind access improves with practice.

- Choosing not to add suffering to pain

**What It Is NOT:**
- Approval or liking the situation
- Giving up or being passive
- Forgiveness (though it may lead there)

**How to Practice:**

1. **Observe** that you're fighting reality
2. **Remind yourself** that reality is what it is
3. **Consider the causes** of this moment (everything has causes)
4. **Practice accepting** with your whole self:

When distressed, try half-smiling with willing hands. Notice how it changes your internal state.

## Choosing the Right Skill

**For Immediate Crisis (high intensity):**
→ TIPP skills first (change body chemistry)
→ Then STOP
→ Then other crisis survival skills

**For Ongoing Distress:**
→ Self-soothing
→ ACCEPTS distraction
→ IMPROVE the moment

**For Reality Resistance:**
→ Radical acceptance
→ Willingness
→ Half-smile and willing hands

**Key Principle:**

Emotion regulation skills help you understand, manage, and change your emotional experiences. These skills are especially valuable for trauma survivors who often experience intense, overwhelming emotions.

## Understanding Emotions

### The Function of Emotions

All emotions serve important functions—they're not the enemy:

| Emotion | Function |
|---------|----------|
| **Fear** | Protects us from danger |
| **Anger** | Signals boundary violations, energizes action |
| **Sadness** | Processes loss, elicits support from others |
| **Joy** | Reinforces what's good, builds connections |
| **Shame** | Maintains social bonds, signals we've violated norms |
| **Guilt** | Motivates repair after wrongdoing |
| **Disgust** | Protects from contamination |
| **Love** | Bonds us to others, motivates care |

**The Problem Isn't Emotions—It's:**
- Emotions that don't fit facts
- Intensity that doesn't match the situation
- Acting on emotions in ineffective ways
- Trying to suppress or avoid emotions
- Getting stuck in emotions

### The Model of Emotions

**1. Prompting Event**
Something happens (internal or external)

**2. Interpretation**
You interpret based on beliefs, history, expectations

**3. Emotional Response**
The emotion arises with:
- Subjective feeling
- Physical sensations
- Urges to act
- Facial expression and body language

**4. Aftereffects**
The emotion influences subsequent thoughts, feelings, behaviors

**Key Insight:** You can intervene at multiple points in this chain.

### The Emotion Wave

All emotions naturally rise, peak, and fall—like waves:
- Emotions don't last forever
- If you don't feed them or fight them, they pass
- Average emotion: 90 seconds to 20 minutes
- Longer emotions are often refueled by thoughts

**Feeding Emotions:**
- Ruminating, overthinking
- Acting on urges
- Adding more thoughts and judgments
- Focusing on the trigger repeatedly

**Fighting Emotions:**
- Trying to suppress or push away
- Judging yourself for feeling
- Denying or minimizing
- Avoiding situations that trigger emotions

**Riding the Wave:**
- Observing without reacting
- Allowing the emotion to be present
- Not feeding or fighting
- Trusting it will pass

## Reducing Emotional Vulnerability

### ABC PLEASE

These skills reduce vulnerability to emotional dysregulation:

---

#### A - Accumulate Positive Experiences

**Short-Term:**

---

#### C - Cope Ahead

Plan for difficult situations before they happen:

**Steps:**
1. **Identify the situation** - What's coming up that might be difficult?
2. **Describe the situation** - Visualize it in detail
3. **Identify emotions** - What might you feel?
4. **Decide on coping** - What skills will you use?
5. **Rehearse in your mind** - Imagine coping effectively
6. **Practice relaxation** - Calm your body after rehearsal

*Example:* If you have a difficult family event coming, visualize it, anticipate triggers, plan your responses, and mentally rehearse staying calm and using skills.

---

#### PLEASE Skills

- Drugs affect emotional regulation
- Even caffeine impacts some people

- Address sleep problems
- Sleep deprivation = emotional vulnerability

**E - Get Exercise**
- Regular physical activity
- 20-30 minutes most days
- Find movement you enjoy
- Exercise is a powerful mood regulator

## Changing Emotional Responses

### Check the Facts

Before acting on emotions, verify your perception matches reality:

**Step 1: Name the Emotion**
What exactly am I feeling? (Be specific)

**Step 2: Identify the Prompting Event**
What triggered this? (Describe facts, not interpretations)

**Step 3: Check Interpretations**
- What am I assuming?
- What meaning am I making?
- Is there another explanation?

**Step 4: Check for Threats**
- Am I expecting the worst?
- What's the actual probability?
- Is there real danger?

**Step 5: Check for Catastrophizing**
- Even if my fear comes true, what would actually happen?
- Could I cope with that?

**Step 6: Does Emotion Fit Facts?**
Is this emotion justified by the actual situation at the actual intensity?

**Step 7: What's Effective?**
What response would serve my goals?

---

### Opposite Action

When emotions don't fit facts or acting on them would be ineffective, act opposite to the urge.

**For Fear (when not in danger):**
| Urge | Opposite Action |
|------|-----------------|
| Avoid | Approach |
| Run away | Stay |
| Freeze | Move |
| Hide | Be visible |

*Do it repeatedly until fear decreases (exposure)*

**For Anger (when unjustified or unhelpful):**
| Urge | Opposite Action |
|------|-----------------|
| Attack | Be gentle |
| Yell | Speak quietly |
| Get big | Get small, step back |
| Focus on wrong | Find empathy or let go |

*Gently avoid the person if needed*

**For Sadness (when action would help):**
| Urge | Opposite Action |
|------|-----------------|
| Withdraw | Approach people |
| Isolate | Reach out |
| Stay inactive | Get active |
| Avoid | Engage |

*Do the opposite even when you don't feel like it*

**For Shame (when unjustified):**
| Urge | Opposite Action |
|------|-----------------|
| Hide | Share with safe people |
| Keep secret | Make public |
| Avoid eye contact | Make eye contact |
| Disappear | Take up space |

*Repeat the behavior if it wasn't actually wrong*

**For Guilt:**
- If unjustified: Opposite action (don't apologize)
- If justified: Make amends, accept consequences, problem-solve

---

### Problem Solving

When emotions are justified and action can help:

1. **Define the problem** clearly and specifically
2. **Check the facts** of the situation
3. **Identify your goal** - What do you want?
4. **Brainstorm solutions** - Generate many options
5. **Evaluate solutions** - Pros and cons of each
6. **Choose the best** solution
7. **Put it into action**
8. **Evaluate results** - Did it work?

Interpersonal effectiveness skills help you navigate relationships, get your needs met, maintain self-respect, and build healthy connections with others.

## Goals of Interpersonal Effectiveness

In any interpersonal interaction, you may have three goals:

### 1. Objectives Effectiveness
Getting what you want or need from the interaction.
- Achieving a tangible outcome
- Having your request granted
- Saying no to an unwanted request

### 2. Relationship Effectiveness
Maintaining or improving the relationship.
- Keeping the relationship positive
- The other person still liking/respecting you
- Not damaging the connection

### 3. Self-Respect Effectiveness
Maintaining your self-respect.
- Acting in line with your values
- Feeling good about yourself afterward
- Not compromising your integrity

**The Challenge:**
Sometimes these goals conflict. You might get what you want but damage the relationship. Or you might keep the relationship but lose self-respect.

**The Skill:**
Being aware of all three goals and balancing them appropriately.

## DEAR MAN: Getting What You Want

DEAR MAN is for objectives effectiveness—getting your needs met or saying no.

### D - Describe

**Describe the situation factually.**
- Stick to objective facts
- No judgments or interpretations
- What happened? What did you observe?

*Example:*
- NOT: "You always ignore me"
- YES: "I've texted you three times this week and haven't gotten a response"

### E - Express

**Express your feelings and opinions.**
- Use "I" statements
- Share how you feel
- Don't expect others to read your mind

*Example:*
- "I feel worried when I don't hear back"
- "I'm frustrated because I need your input on this"

### A - Assert

**Assert what you want or don't want.**
- Ask clearly for what you need
- Say no clearly if needed
- Don't assume they know
- Be specific

*Example:*
- "I would like you to respond within 24 hours, even just to say you'll get back to me later"
- "I'm not able to take on that project right now"

### R - Reinforce

**Reinforce (reward) the person for responding.**
- Explain benefits of giving you what you want
- Explain consequences of not
- Make it worth their while

*Example:*
- "If you can let me know you got my message, I won't worry and won't need to follow up"
- "I'd really appreciate it and it would help me a lot"

### M - Stay Mindful

**Stay mindful of your goals.**
- Don't get distracted
- Return to your point if they change the subject
- Broken record: calmly repeat your request

*Technique - Broken Record:*
Calmly repeat your request or no, regardless of what the other person says:
- "I understand, and I still need an answer by Friday"
- "I hear you, and I'm still not able to do that"

### A - Appear Confident

**Appear confident in your manner.**
- Maintain eye contact
- Speak clearly, not too quietly
- Stand/sit upright

### N - Negotiate

**Be willing to negotiate.**

- Ask for their ideas
- Turn the tables: "What do you suggest?"
- Reduce your request or offer something

*Example:*
- "If you can't do all of it, could you do this part?"

- Don't dismiss or minimize
- You can validate without agreeing

*Examples:*
- "I can see why you'd feel that way"
- "That makes sense given what you've been through"
- "I understand this is frustrating for you"

### E - Use an Easy Manner

**Use an easy, non-threatening manner.**
