## What Is CBT?

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is one of the most researched and effective approaches to treating trauma-related conditions. CBT is based on the understanding that our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected, and that changing one can influence the others.

\`\`\`chart:TherapyEffectivenessChart\`\`\`

### The CBT Triangle

At the core of CBT is the cognitive triangle, which illustrates how thoughts, feelings, and behaviors influence each other:

**Thoughts → Feelings → Behaviors → Thoughts**

**Example:**
- **Situation:** You see someone you know and wave, but they don't respond.
- **Thought:** "They're ignoring me. They must not like me."
- **Feeling:** Hurt, anxious, rejected
- **Behavior:** Avoid that person, withdraw socially
- **Result:** Less connection, more isolation, reinforced belief that people don't like you

**Alternative:**
- **Situation:** Same
- **Thought:** "They probably didn't see me. Maybe they were distracted."
- **Feeling:** Neutral, mildly curious
- **Behavior:** Try again next time, or check in with them
- **Result:** Maintained connection, neutral or positive outcome

The key insight: by changing our thoughts, we can influence our feelings and behaviors.

### Why CBT Works for Trauma

Trauma often creates or reinforces distorted thinking patterns:
- Self-blame ("It was my fault")
- Overgeneralization ("No one can be trusted")
- Catastrophizing ("I'll never recover")
- All-or-nothing thinking ("If I'm not perfect, I'm worthless")

CBT helps identify and challenge these patterns, replacing them with more accurate, helpful thoughts.

## Cognitive Distortions

Cognitive distortions are systematic errors in thinking that maintain negative beliefs and emotional distress. Recognizing them is the first step to changing them.

### Common Cognitive Distortions

**All-or-Nothing Thinking (Black-and-White Thinking)**
Seeing things in absolute, extreme categories with no middle ground.
- *Example:* "If I'm not perfect, I'm a complete failure."
- *Trauma connection:* "Either the world is completely safe or completely dangerous."

**Catastrophizing**
Expecting the worst possible outcome.
- *Example:* "If I make a mistake, my life will be ruined."
- *Trauma connection:* Living in constant fear of another trauma.

**Mind Reading**
Assuming you know what others are thinking.
- *Example:* "Everyone thinks I'm weird."
- *Trauma connection:* Assuming others judge you for your trauma.

**Fortune Telling**
Predicting the future negatively.
- *Example:* "I'll definitely fail."
- *Trauma connection:* "I'll never get better."

**Personalization**
Taking responsibility for things outside your control.
- *Example:* "My parents divorced because of me."
- *Trauma connection:* Self-blame for abuse or trauma.

**Emotional Reasoning**
Believing that feelings are facts.
- *Example:* "I feel worthless, so I must be worthless."
- *Trauma connection:* "I feel damaged, so I am damaged."

**Should Statements**
Rigid rules about how things must be.
- *Example:* "I should always be strong."
- *Trauma connection:* "I should be over this by now."

**Mental Filtering**
Focusing only on negative aspects while ignoring positives.
- *Example:* Ignoring 99 positive comments and fixating on 1 criticism.
- *Trauma connection:* Focusing only on danger signs, missing safety.

**Discounting the Positive**
Dismissing positive experiences as not counting.
- *Example:* "That compliment doesn't count because they were just being nice."
- *Trauma connection:* "My progress doesn't matter because I'm still struggling."

**Labeling**
Attaching fixed, negative labels to yourself or others.
- *Example:* "I'm an idiot" instead of "I made a mistake."
- *Trauma connection:* "I'm broken," "I'm damaged goods."

**Magnification/Minimization**
Exaggerating negatives or minimizing positives.
- *Example:* Making small mistakes huge while dismissing accomplishments.
- *Trauma connection:* Minimizing your healing progress.

**Blame**
Holding others entirely responsible for your feelings or situations.
- *Example:* "They made me feel this way."
- *Note:* This is different from appropriately placing responsibility for abuse.

## CBT Techniques

### Thought Records

Thought records are structured tools for identifying and challenging automatic thoughts.

**Step 1: Situation**
Describe what happened. Be specific and objective.
*Example:* "My friend didn't respond to my text for 24 hours."

**Step 2: Automatic Thought**
What went through your mind?
*Example:* "She's ignoring me. I must have done something wrong. She doesn't want to be my friend anymore."

**Step 3: Emotion**
What did you feel, and how intensely (0-100)?
*Example:* "Anxious (80), Sad (70), Hurt (65)"

**Step 4: Evidence For**
What supports this thought?
*Example:* "She usually responds faster. She seemed distant last time we talked."

**Step 5: Evidence Against**
What contradicts this thought?
*Example:* "She's been busy with work. She's been a good friend for years. I haven't done anything wrong that I know of. She often forgets to respond to everyone."

**Step 6: Balanced Thought**
What's a more realistic perspective?
*Example:* "She's probably just busy. If there's an issue, she'll tell me. One delayed text doesn't mean our friendship is over."

**Step 7: New Emotion**
How do you feel now (0-100)?
*Example:* "Anxious (30), Sad (20)"

### Behavioral Experiments

Test your beliefs in real life to see if they hold up.

**Steps:**
1. Identify a prediction based on a belief
2. Design an experiment to test it
3. Make a specific prediction about what will happen
4. Conduct the experiment
5. Record the results
6. Draw conclusions

**Example:**
- **Belief:** "People will think I'm weird if I share my opinion."
- **Experiment:** Share an opinion in a meeting.
- **Prediction:** "People will react negatively."
- **Result:** "Two people agreed, one disagreed respectfully, most didn't react much."
- **Conclusion:** "Sharing opinions doesn't lead to universal rejection."

### Behavioral Activation

When we're depressed or anxious, we tend to withdraw. This creates a downward spiral:
Less activity → Lower mood → Less motivation → Even less activity

**Breaking the Cycle:**
1. **Track activities:** Note what you do and how you feel
2. **Identify patterns:** What activities boost your mood?
3. **Schedule activities:** Plan enjoyable and meaningful activities
4. **Start small:** Even tiny steps count
5. **Do it anyway:** Don't wait for motivation

**Activity Categories:**
- **Pleasure activities:** Things you enjoy
- **Mastery activities:** Things that give a sense of accomplishment
- **Values-based activities:** Things aligned with what matters to you

## Applying CBT to Trauma

### Challenging Trauma-Related Beliefs

CBT for trauma specifically addresses beliefs about:
- **The self:** "I am damaged," "I am to blame"
- **Others:** "No one can be trusted," "People are dangerous"
- **The world:** "The world is completely unsafe," "Bad things always happen"
- **The future:** "I'll never get better," "I can't handle anything"

### Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)

CPT is a specific CBT protocol for PTSD that focuses on "stuck points"—problematic beliefs about the trauma.

**Stuck Point Examples:**
- "It was my fault because I didn't fight back"
- "I should have known better"
- "I'm damaged forever"
- "I can't trust anyone ever again"

**CPT Process:**
1. Identify stuck points
2. Examine evidence for and against
3. Generate more balanced perspectives
4. Apply new understanding to life

Learning to identify and challenge unhelpful thoughts is a core CBT skill. This chapter provides detailed guidance on this essential practice.

## Understanding Automatic Thoughts

### What Are Automatic Thoughts?

Automatic thoughts are the quick, spontaneous thoughts that pop into our minds in response to situations. They're called "automatic" because:
- They happen instantly
- They often go unnoticed
- They feel like facts rather than thoughts
- They're influenced by underlying beliefs

### Characteristics of Automatic Thoughts

- Brief and rapid
- Can be words, images, or memories
- Often negative when struggling
- Feel believable in the moment
- Connected to emotions

### Catching Automatic Thoughts

To work with automatic thoughts, you first need to notice them:

**When you notice a strong emotion, ask:**
- What just went through my mind?
- What am I telling myself about this situation?
- What images or memories came up?
- What am I predicting will happen?

**Tips for catching thoughts:**
- Slow down when emotions rise
- Practice regularly, even with minor situations
- Keep a thought diary
- Notice physical sensations as cues

## The Thought Record Process

### Detailed Steps

**Step 1: Describe the Situation**
Be specific and factual. Avoid interpretations.

*Not:* "My friend was rude to me"
*But:* "My friend didn't respond to my greeting in the hallway"

**Step 2: Identify Automatic Thoughts**
What went through your mind? Be specific.

*Questions to ask:*
- What was I thinking?
- What did this mean to me?
- What did I predict would happen?
- What memories or images came up?
- What does this say about me/others/the world/the future?

**Step 3: Identify Emotions**
Name your emotions and rate intensity (0-100).

*Common emotions:* Sad, anxious, angry, hurt, ashamed, guilty, afraid, hopeless, jealous, frustrated

**Step 4: Gather Evidence FOR the Thought**
What supports this thought? Be specific and factual.

*Note:* This isn't about agreeing with the thought—it's about being thorough before challenging it.

**Step 5: Gather Evidence AGAINST the Thought**
What contradicts this thought?

*Questions to ask:*
- Is there another way to look at this?
- What would I tell a friend thinking this?
- Am I ignoring any facts?
- What has happened in similar situations?
- What would a neutral observer say?
- Am I thinking in extremes?
- Is there information I'm missing?

**Step 6: Develop a Balanced Thought**
Create a more accurate, nuanced perspective.

*Not:* Just the opposite of the negative thought
*But:* A synthesis that incorporates evidence from both sides

**Step 7: Re-Rate Emotions**
How do you feel now? Rate the same emotions again.

*Note:* The goal isn't to eliminate negative emotions, but to reduce their intensity when driven by distortions.

### Example Thought Record

**Situation:**
I presented at work and stumbled over my words a few times.

**Automatic Thoughts:**
"I'm terrible at my job. Everyone noticed how incompetent I am. I'll probably get fired."

**Emotions:**
Anxious (85), Ashamed (75), Hopeless (60)

**Evidence For:**
- I did stumble a few times
- Presentations are important at work
- I felt nervous during the presentation

**Evidence Against:**
- I've done many successful presentations before
- People stumble sometimes; it's normal
- Several people gave positive feedback after
- My boss hasn't expressed concern about my performance
- I know the material well—nervousness isn't the same as incompetence
- I've never been disciplined at work

**Balanced Thought:**
I stumbled during my presentation, which happens to everyone sometimes. It doesn't mean I'm incompetent—I know my material well and have a track record of success. The nervousness was uncomfortable but didn't ruin the presentation. Several people responded positively.

**Emotions Now:**
Anxious (40), Ashamed (30), Hopeless (20)

## Practice Tips

**Start Small:**
Practice with minor situations before tackling major distress.

**Write It Out:**
Don't just think it through—writing engages the thinking brain more fully.

**Be Curious, Not Judgmental:**
Approach your thoughts with curiosity rather than criticism.

**Practice Daily:**
The skill develops with regular practice.

**Remember:**
The goal isn't positive thinking—it's realistic thinking. Sometimes negative thoughts are accurate, but often they're distorted.

      content: `# CBT Behavioral Strategies

Changing behavior is often the fastest way to change thoughts and feelings. CBT uses several behavioral strategies to break negative cycles.

## Behavioral Activation

When struggling with depression, trauma, or anxiety, we often withdraw from activities. This creates a downward spiral that behavioral activation interrupts.

### The Downward Spiral

Less activity → Lower mood → Less motivation → Even less activity → Worse mood → Even less motivation...

### Breaking the Cycle

The key insight: behavior can come before motivation. Waiting to "feel like" doing something often leads to never doing it.

**Action → Mood improvement → More motivation → More action**

### The Behavioral Activation Process

**Step 1: Track Your Activities and Mood**
For a week, record:
- What you did each hour
- Your mood rating (1-10)

Look for patterns:
- What activities boost your mood?
- What activities lower it?
- When are you most active? Most withdrawn?

**Step 2: Identify Values and Goals**
Consider what matters to you:
- Relationships
- Work/career
- Health/wellness
- Recreation/fun
- Spirituality
- Personal growth

**Step 3: Schedule Activities**
Plan activities that are:
- **Pleasant:** Enjoyable or fun
- **Mastery:** Give sense of accomplishment
- **Values-aligned:** Connected to what matters

**Step 4: Start Small**
Don't try to do everything at once:
- Break activities into small steps
- Start with the most manageable
- Celebrate small wins

**Step 5: Don't Wait for Motivation**
Remember: action precedes motivation
- Schedule it and do it regardless of how you feel
- Notice mood changes after (not before)
- Build gradually

### Tips for Success

- Be specific (not "exercise" but "walk for 15 minutes at 9am")
- Anticipate obstacles and plan for them
- Build in accountability
- Track your mood to see progress
- Adjust as needed

## Exposure Therapy

Avoiding trauma reminders feels protective but actually keeps fear alive. Exposure therapy helps reduce fear through gradual, controlled contact with avoided situations.

### How Avoidance Maintains Fear

When we avoid something, we:
- Never learn it's not dangerous
- Reinforce the belief that we can't handle it
- Narrow our lives around the avoidance
- Feel temporary relief that reinforces avoiding

### How Exposure Works

**Habituation:**
With repeated, prolonged exposure, anxiety naturally decreases.

**Learning:**
We learn that the feared outcome doesn't happen, or that we can cope.

**Self-efficacy:**
We learn we're capable of facing difficult things.

### The Exposure Process

**Step 1: Create a Fear Hierarchy**
List avoided situations related to trauma and rate each (0-100 fear level).

*Example for car accident trauma:*
- Sitting in parked car (30)
- Being a passenger on quiet streets (40)
- Being a passenger on busy streets (55)
- Driving on quiet streets (60)
- Driving on busy streets (75)
- Driving on the freeway (85)
- Driving past the accident site (95)

**Step 2: Start with Manageable Items**
Begin with something that causes moderate anxiety (40-50), not the most feared item.

**Step 3: Stay Until Anxiety Decreases**
Remain in the situation until anxiety drops by at least half. This usually takes 30-90 minutes.

**Step 4: Repeat**
Practice repeatedly until the item no longer causes significant fear.

**Step 5: Move Up the Hierarchy**
Gradually work up to more challenging items.

### Types of Exposure

**In Vivo Exposure:**
Real-life exposure to feared situations.

**Imaginal Exposure:**
Vividly imagining the feared situation or memory.

**Interoceptive Exposure:**
Exposure to physical sensations of anxiety (heart racing, shortness of breath).

### Safety Notes

- Exposure for trauma should be done with professional guidance
- It's powerful and needs to be paced appropriately
- Work with a trained trauma therapist
- Ensure adequate coping skills are in place first

## Response Prevention

Often paired with exposure, response prevention involves resisting compulsive or avoidant behaviors.

**Examples:**
- Exposure to anxiety + not engaging in safety behaviors
- Facing a trigger + not using substances to cope
- Feeling an urge + not acting on it

**The Goal:**
Learn that you can tolerate discomfort without engaging in unhelpful behaviors.

## What Is the CBT Triangle?

The CBT Triangle is one of the most powerful tools for understanding how our inner experiences shape our lives. It illustrates a fundamental truth: our **thoughts**, **feelings**, and **behaviors** are deeply interconnected, constantly influencing each other in a continuous cycle.

This isn't just theory—it's a map of how human experience actually works. Understanding this triangle gives you insight into why you react the way you do and, more importantly, shows you where you have the power to create change.

**The Triangle Structure:**

\`\`\`
           THOUGHTS
          (Cognitions)
         "What I think"
              /\\
             /  \\
            /    \\
           /      \\
          /        \\
         /          \\
        /            \\
   FEELINGS -------- BEHAVIORS
   (Emotions)         (Actions)
  "What I feel"     "What I do"
\`\`\`

---

## The Three Components

### Thoughts (Cognitions)

**What they are:** The running commentary in your mind—interpretations, beliefs, assumptions, predictions, and judgments about yourself, others, and the world.

**Examples:**
- "I'm not good enough"
- "Something bad is going to happen"
- "They must think I'm stupid"
- "I can't handle this"
- "Nobody understands me"

**Key insight:** Thoughts are not facts. They're interpretations that can be accurate, distorted, or anywhere in between. Many thoughts happen automatically, without conscious choice, especially when we're triggered or stressed.

### Feelings (Emotions)

**What they are:** The emotional experiences in your body—the felt sensations that arise in response to thoughts and situations.

**Examples:**
- Anxiety (chest tightness, racing heart)
- Sadness (heaviness, low energy)
- Anger (heat, tension)
- Shame (wanting to hide, feeling small)
- Fear (hyperalert, ready to flee)

**Key insight:** Feelings are valid information about your internal state. They're neither good nor bad—they're messengers. However, feelings don't always reflect reality; they often reflect our thoughts about reality.

### Behaviors (Actions)

**What they are:** What you actually do or don't do—observable actions, as well as avoidance, withdrawal, or patterns of inaction.

**Examples:**
- Isolating from others
- Reaching for a substance
- Snapping at someone
- Avoiding certain places or situations
- Checking social media repeatedly
- Procrastinating on important tasks

**Key insight:** Behaviors are where you often have the most immediate control. Even when thoughts and feelings feel overwhelming, you can choose different actions, which then influences the other two points.

---

## How the Triangle Works: The Interconnected Cycle

The three points of the triangle constantly influence each other, creating cycles that can be either helpful or harmful. Here's the crucial part: **you can enter this cycle at any point, and changing one component affects the others.**

### Example Cycle 1: The Anxiety Spiral

**Situation:** You need to attend a social gathering

**Thought:** "I'll embarrass myself. Everyone will judge me."

**Feeling:** Anxiety (heart racing, stomach churning, sweating)

**Behavior:** Cancel plans, stay home, avoid the situation

**New Thought:** "See, I can't handle social situations. I'm broken."

**Stronger Feeling:** More intense anxiety, plus shame

**Reinforced Behavior:** Avoid even more situations

*This is how patterns become entrenched.* Each cycle reinforces itself, making the thoughts feel more true, the feelings more intense, and the behaviors more automatic.

### Example Cycle 2: Breaking the Pattern

**Situation:** Same social gathering invitation

**Different Thought:** "I feel anxious, but I've handled situations like this before. I can leave if I need to."

**Feeling:** Still some anxiety, but also a bit of hope or determination

**Behavior:** Attend for 30 minutes, use grounding techniques, talk to one person

**New Thought:** "That wasn't as bad as I feared. I actually had a decent conversation."

**New Feeling:** Relief, small sense of accomplishment, reduced anxiety

**New Behavior:** More willing to try again next time

*This is how healing happens.* Small changes in one area create ripples throughout the whole system.

---

## The Power of Awareness

Before you can change any part of the triangle, you need to see it clearly. Most of the time, these three components blur together so quickly that we experience them as one overwhelming wave. Slowing down to identify each piece is the first step.

**Practice identifying the components:**

| Component | Question to Ask |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Situation | What actually happened? (just the facts) |
| Thought | What went through my mind? |
| Feeling | What emotion(s) did I experience? Where in my body? |
| Behavior | What did I do (or not do) in response? |

---

## Common Cognitive Distortions

Our thoughts aren't always accurate reflections of reality. Trauma, stress, anxiety, and depression can create distorted thinking patterns that fuel negative cycles.

### All-or-Nothing Thinking

**Pattern:** "If I'm not perfect, I'm a complete failure."

**Reality:** Most things exist on a spectrum. There's vast territory between perfect and failure.

### Catastrophizing

**Pattern:** "This headache means something terrible. Everything is going to fall apart."

**Reality:** Jumping to worst-case scenarios creates unnecessary suffering. Most fears don't materialize.

### Mind Reading

**Pattern:** "They think I'm pathetic. I can tell by how they looked at me."

**Reality:** You can't actually know what others think without asking. Assumptions are often wrong.

### Emotional Reasoning

**Pattern:** "I feel like a failure, so I must be one."

**Reality:** Feelings are real, but they don't define truth. You can feel something intensely and it can still be inaccurate.

### Should Statements

**Pattern:** "I should be over this by now. I shouldn't feel this way."

**Reality:** "Shoulds" create shame and pressure. Working with reality is more effective than demanding it be different.

### Personalization

**Pattern:** "My friend is quiet today. I must have done something to upset them."

**Reality:** Other people's moods and behaviors are usually about their own experiences, not about you.

### Overgeneralization

**Pattern:** "I messed up this presentation. I always fail at everything important."

**Reality:** One event doesn't define a pattern. "Always" and "never" are rarely accurate.

---

## Where to Intervene: Three Points of Entry

The beauty of the CBT triangle is that you can create change by working on any of the three points.

### 1. Changing Thoughts (Cognitive Restructuring)

**Technique:** Question and reframe automatic thoughts

1. Notice the thought
2. Ask: "Is this thought accurate? What evidence supports or contradicts it?"
3. Consider alternative interpretations
4. Create a more balanced thought

**Example:**
- Automatic thought: "I'm a complete failure"
- Question: "Am I really a complete failure in every area?"
- Balanced thought: "I made a mistake in this situation, but I've also handled many things well. I'm learning."

### 2. Changing Feelings (Emotional Regulation)

**Technique:** Work directly with the emotion in your body

1. Name the emotion specifically
2. Locate it in your body
3. Use techniques to shift the intensity:
   - Deep breathing
   - Progressive muscle relaxation
   - Grounding exercises
   - Physical movement
   - Opposite action

**Example:** When anxiety is high, use box breathing (4 counts in, 4 hold, 4 out, 4 hold) to activate your parasympathetic nervous system.

### 3. Changing Behaviors (Behavioral Activation)

**Technique:** Act differently, even when thoughts and feelings haven't changed yet

1. Identify the behavior you're doing (or avoiding)
2. Choose a different action, even a small one
3. Notice what happens to your thoughts and feelings afterward

**Example:** When depression says "stay in bed," getting up and taking a shower might feel impossible—but doing it anyway often shifts mood and thoughts, even slightly.

---

## The CBT Triangle and Trauma

For trauma survivors, the CBT triangle has special considerations.

### Trauma-Conditioned Responses

Trauma creates powerful, automatic connections in the triangle. A trigger can instantly activate all three components simultaneously:

**Trigger:** Someone raises their voice

**Thought:** "I'm in danger" (often unconscious)

**Feeling:** Terror, freeze response

**Behavior:** Dissociation, shutdown, or panic

These responses happen faster than conscious thought because trauma has created neural pathways designed to protect you.

### When Cognitive Work Has Limits

When you're triggered or in a flashback, your prefrontal cortex (rational thinking brain) is often offline. This means:

- In crisis moments, **behavioral and body-based interventions** are usually more effective than trying to change thoughts
- Cognitive work is most effective when you're in a **window of tolerance**
- Sometimes thoughts like "I'm in danger" accurately reflect past reality, even if they're not accurate now

### Building New Triangles

Recovery involves creating new, healthier cycles:

**Old Triangle:**
Trigger - "I'm worthless" - Shame - Isolation - Confirms worthlessness

**New Triangle:**
Trigger - "This is a trauma response, I'm safe now" - Still uncomfortable, but grounded - Reach out to support - Confirms you can handle hard things

Building these new patterns takes time and repetition. Each time you complete a healthier cycle, you're literally rewiring your brain.

## Practical Worksheet: Breaking Down a Situation

Think of a recent difficult situation. Break it down:

**Situation (just the facts):**
What happened? Where were you?

---

**Thoughts:**
What went through your mind?

---

**Feelings:**
What emotions did you experience? Where in your body?

---

**Behaviors:**
What did you do or not do?

---

**What do you notice?**
How did these three components influence each other?

---

**Where could you intervene?**
- Could you challenge or reframe the thought?
- Could you regulate the feeling with a coping skill?
- Could you choose a different behavior?

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Everything is connected:** Your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors form an interconnected system where changing one affects the others.

2. **You have multiple entry points:** You don't have to start with thoughts. Sometimes changing behavior or regulating emotion is easier and more effective.

3. **Awareness is the first step:** Simply noticing the three components separately gives you power over automatic patterns.

4. **Thoughts aren't facts:** Just because you think something doesn't make it true. Thoughts can be questioned, examined, and changed.

5. **Small changes create ripples:** You don't need to transform everything at once. Small shifts in one area will influence the whole system.

6. **Trauma requires extra care:** For trauma survivors, some responses bypass rational thinking. Be patient with yourself and use the right tools for the situation.

7. **New patterns take practice:** Your brain has carved deep grooves for old patterns. Creating new ones requires repetition, not perfection.
