## What Is CBT?

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is one of the most researched and effective approaches to treating trauma-related conditions. CBT is based on the understanding that our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected, and that changing one can influence the others.

\`\`\`chart:TherapyEffectivenessChart\`\`\`

### The CBT Triangle

At the core of CBT is the cognitive triangle, which illustrates how thoughts, feelings, and behaviors influence each other:

**Thoughts → Feelings → Behaviors → Thoughts**

**Example:**
- **Situation:** You see someone you know and wave, but they don't respond.
- **Thought:** "They're ignoring me. They must not like me."
- **Feeling:** Hurt, anxious, rejected
- **Behavior:** Avoid that person, withdraw socially
- **Result:** Less connection, more isolation, reinforced belief that people don't like you

**Alternative:**
- **Situation:** Same
- **Thought:** "They probably didn't see me. Maybe they were distracted."
- **Feeling:** Neutral, mildly curious
- **Behavior:** Try again next time, or check in with them
- **Result:** Maintained connection, neutral or positive outcome

The key insight: by changing our thoughts, we can influence our feelings and behaviors.

### Why CBT Works for Trauma

Trauma often creates or reinforces distorted thinking patterns:
- Self-blame ("It was my fault")
- Overgeneralization ("No one can be trusted")
- Catastrophizing ("I'll never recover")
- All-or-nothing thinking ("If I'm not perfect, I'm worthless")

CBT helps identify and challenge these patterns, replacing them with more accurate, helpful thoughts.

## Cognitive Distortions

Cognitive distortions are systematic errors in thinking that maintain negative beliefs and emotional distress. Recognizing them is the first step to changing them.

### Common Cognitive Distortions

**All-or-Nothing Thinking (Black-and-White Thinking)**
Seeing things in absolute, extreme categories with no middle ground.
- *Example:* "If I'm not perfect, I'm a complete failure."
- *Trauma connection:* "Either the world is completely safe or completely dangerous."

**Catastrophizing**
Expecting the worst possible outcome.
- *Example:* "If I make a mistake, my life will be ruined."
- *Trauma connection:* Living in constant fear of another trauma.

**Mind Reading**
Assuming you know what others are thinking.
- *Example:* "Everyone thinks I'm weird."
- *Trauma connection:* Assuming others judge you for your trauma.

**Fortune Telling**
Predicting the future negatively.
- *Example:* "I'll definitely fail."
- *Trauma connection:* "I'll never get better."

**Personalization**
Taking responsibility for things outside your control.
- *Example:* "My parents divorced because of me."
- *Trauma connection:* Self-blame for abuse or trauma.

**Emotional Reasoning**
Believing that feelings are facts.
- *Example:* "I feel worthless, so I must be worthless."
- *Trauma connection:* "I feel damaged, so I am damaged."

**Should Statements**
Rigid rules about how things must be.
- *Example:* "I should always be strong."
- *Trauma connection:* "I should be over this by now."

**Mental Filtering**
Focusing only on negative aspects while ignoring positives.
- *Example:* Ignoring 99 positive comments and fixating on 1 criticism.
- *Trauma connection:* Focusing only on danger signs, missing safety.

**Discounting the Positive**
Dismissing positive experiences as not counting.
- *Example:* "That compliment doesn't count because they were just being nice."
- *Trauma connection:* "My progress doesn't matter because I'm still struggling."

**Labeling**
Attaching fixed, negative labels to yourself or others.
- *Example:* "I'm an idiot" instead of "I made a mistake."
- *Trauma connection:* "I'm broken," "I'm damaged goods."

**Magnification/Minimization**
Exaggerating negatives or minimizing positives.
- *Example:* Making small mistakes huge while dismissing accomplishments.
- *Trauma connection:* Minimizing your healing progress.

**Blame**
Holding others entirely responsible for your feelings or situations.
- *Example:* "They made me feel this way."
- *Note:* This is different from appropriately placing responsibility for abuse.

## CBT Techniques

### Thought Records

Thought records are structured tools for identifying and challenging automatic thoughts.

**Step 1: Situation**
Describe what happened. Be specific and objective.
*Example:* "My friend didn't respond to my text for 24 hours."

**Step 2: Automatic Thought**
What went through your mind?
*Example:* "She's ignoring me. I must have done something wrong. She doesn't want to be my friend anymore."

**Step 3: Emotion**
What did you feel, and how intensely (0-100)?
*Example:* "Anxious (80), Sad (70), Hurt (65)"

**Step 4: Evidence For**
What supports this thought?
*Example:* "She usually responds faster. She seemed distant last time we talked."

**Step 5: Evidence Against**
What contradicts this thought?
*Example:* "She's been busy with work. She's been a good friend for years. I haven't done anything wrong that I know of. She often forgets to respond to everyone."

**Step 6: Balanced Thought**
What's a more realistic perspective?
*Example:* "She's probably just busy. If there's an issue, she'll tell me. One delayed text doesn't mean our friendship is over."

**Step 7: New Emotion**
How do you feel now (0-100)?
*Example:* "Anxious (30), Sad (20)"

### Behavioral Experiments

Test your beliefs in real life to see if they hold up.

**Steps:**
1. Identify a prediction based on a belief
2. Design an experiment to test it
3. Make a specific prediction about what will happen
4. Conduct the experiment
5. Record the results
6. Draw conclusions

**Example:**
- **Belief:** "People will think I'm weird if I share my opinion."
- **Experiment:** Share an opinion in a meeting.
- **Prediction:** "People will react negatively."
- **Result:** "Two people agreed, one disagreed respectfully, most didn't react much."
- **Conclusion:** "Sharing opinions doesn't lead to universal rejection."

### Behavioral Activation

When we're depressed or anxious, we tend to withdraw. This creates a downward spiral:
Less activity → Lower mood → Less motivation → Even less activity

**Breaking the Cycle:**
1. **Track activities:** Note what you do and how you feel
2. **Identify patterns:** What activities boost your mood?
3. **Schedule activities:** Plan enjoyable and meaningful activities
4. **Start small:** Even tiny steps count
5. **Do it anyway:** Don't wait for motivation

**Activity Categories:**
- **Pleasure activities:** Things you enjoy
- **Mastery activities:** Things that give a sense of accomplishment
- **Values-based activities:** Things aligned with what matters to you

## Applying CBT to Trauma

### Challenging Trauma-Related Beliefs

CBT for trauma specifically addresses beliefs about:
- **The self:** "I am damaged," "I am to blame"
- **Others:** "No one can be trusted," "People are dangerous"
- **The world:** "The world is completely unsafe," "Bad things always happen"
- **The future:** "I'll never get better," "I can't handle anything"

### Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)

CPT is a specific CBT protocol for PTSD that focuses on "stuck points"—problematic beliefs about the trauma.

**Stuck Point Examples:**
- "It was my fault because I didn't fight back"
- "I should have known better"
- "I'm damaged forever"
- "I can't trust anyone ever again"

**CPT Process:**
1. Identify stuck points
2. Examine evidence for and against
3. Generate more balanced perspectives
4. Apply new understanding to life

Learning to identify and challenge unhelpful thoughts is a core CBT skill. This chapter provides detailed guidance on this essential practice.

## Understanding Automatic Thoughts

### What Are Automatic Thoughts?

Automatic thoughts are the quick, spontaneous thoughts that pop into our minds in response to situations. They're called "automatic" because:
- They happen instantly
- They often go unnoticed
- They feel like facts rather than thoughts
- They're influenced by underlying beliefs

### Characteristics of Automatic Thoughts

- Brief and rapid
- Can be words, images, or memories
- Often negative when struggling
- Feel believable in the moment
- Connected to emotions

### Catching Automatic Thoughts

To work with automatic thoughts, you first need to notice them:

**When you notice a strong emotion, ask:**
- What just went through my mind?
- What am I telling myself about this situation?
- What images or memories came up?
- What am I predicting will happen?

**Tips for catching thoughts:**
- Slow down when emotions rise
- Practice regularly, even with minor situations
- Keep a thought diary
- Notice physical sensations as cues

## The Thought Record Process

### Detailed Steps

**Step 1: Describe the Situation**
Be specific and factual. Avoid interpretations.

*Not:* "My friend was rude to me"
*But:* "My friend didn't respond to my greeting in the hallway"

**Step 2: Identify Automatic Thoughts**
What went through your mind? Be specific.

*Questions to ask:*
- What was I thinking?
- What did this mean to me?
- What did I predict would happen?
- What memories or images came up?
- What does this say about me/others/the world/the future?

**Step 3: Identify Emotions**
Name your emotions and rate intensity (0-100).

*Common emotions:* Sad, anxious, angry, hurt, ashamed, guilty, afraid, hopeless, jealous, frustrated

**Step 4: Gather Evidence FOR the Thought**
What supports this thought? Be specific and factual.

*Note:* This isn't about agreeing with the thought—it's about being thorough before challenging it.

**Step 5: Gather Evidence AGAINST the Thought**
What contradicts this thought?

*Questions to ask:*
- Is there another way to look at this?
- What would I tell a friend thinking this?
- Am I ignoring any facts?
- What has happened in similar situations?
- What would a neutral observer say?
- Am I thinking in extremes?
- Is there information I'm missing?

**Step 6: Develop a Balanced Thought**
Create a more accurate, nuanced perspective.

*Not:* Just the opposite of the negative thought
*But:* A synthesis that incorporates evidence from both sides

**Step 7: Re-Rate Emotions**
How do you feel now? Rate the same emotions again.

*Note:* The goal isn't to eliminate negative emotions, but to reduce their intensity when driven by distortions.

### Example Thought Record

**Situation:**
I presented at work and stumbled over my words a few times.

**Automatic Thoughts:**
"I'm terrible at my job. Everyone noticed how incompetent I am. I'll probably get fired."

**Emotions:**
Anxious (85), Ashamed (75), Hopeless (60)

**Evidence For:**
- I did stumble a few times
- Presentations are important at work
- I felt nervous during the presentation

**Evidence Against:**
- I've done many successful presentations before
- People stumble sometimes; it's normal
- Several people gave positive feedback after
- My boss hasn't expressed concern about my performance
- I know the material well—nervousness isn't the same as incompetence
- I've never been disciplined at work

**Balanced Thought:**
I stumbled during my presentation, which happens to everyone sometimes. It doesn't mean I'm incompetent—I know my material well and have a track record of success. The nervousness was uncomfortable but didn't ruin the presentation. Several people responded positively.

**Emotions Now:**
Anxious (40), Ashamed (30), Hopeless (20)

## Practice Tips

**Start Small:**
Practice with minor situations before tackling major distress.

**Write It Out:**
Don't just think it through—writing engages the thinking brain more fully.

**Be Curious, Not Judgmental:**
Approach your thoughts with curiosity rather than criticism.

**Practice Daily:**
The skill develops with regular practice.

**Remember:**
The goal isn't positive thinking—it's realistic thinking. Sometimes negative thoughts are accurate, but often they're distorted.

Changing behavior is often the fastest way to change thoughts and feelings. CBT uses several behavioral strategies to break negative cycles.

## Behavioral Activation

When struggling with depression, trauma, or anxiety, we often withdraw from activities. This creates a downward spiral that behavioral activation interrupts.

### The Downward Spiral

Less activity → Lower mood → Less motivation → Even less activity → Worse mood → Even less motivation...

### Breaking the Cycle

The key insight: behavior can come before motivation. Waiting to "feel like" doing something often leads to never doing it.

**Action → Mood improvement → More motivation → More action**

### The Behavioral Activation Process

**Step 1: Track Your Activities and Mood**
For a week, record:
- What you did each hour
- Your mood rating (1-10)

Look for patterns:
- What activities boost your mood?
- What activities lower it?
- When are you most active? Most withdrawn?

**Step 2: Identify Values and Goals**
Consider what matters to you:
- Relationships
- Work/career
- Health/wellness
- Recreation/fun
- Spirituality
- Personal growth

**Step 3: Schedule Activities**
Plan activities that are:
- **Pleasant:** Enjoyable or fun
- **Mastery:** Give sense of accomplishment
- **Values-aligned:** Connected to what matters

**Step 4: Start Small**
Don't try to do everything at once:
- Break activities into small steps
- Start with the most manageable
- Celebrate small wins

**Step 5: Don't Wait for Motivation**
Remember: action precedes motivation
- Schedule it and do it regardless of how you feel
- Notice mood changes after (not before)
- Build gradually

### Tips for Success

- Be specific (not "exercise" but "walk for 15 minutes at 9am")
- Anticipate obstacles and plan for them
- Build in accountability
- Track your mood to see progress
- Adjust as needed

## Exposure Therapy

Avoiding trauma reminders feels protective but actually keeps fear alive. Exposure therapy helps reduce fear through gradual, controlled contact with avoided situations.

### How Avoidance Maintains Fear

When we avoid something, we:
- Never learn it's not dangerous
- Reinforce the belief that we can't handle it
- Narrow our lives around the avoidance
- Feel temporary relief that reinforces avoiding

### How Exposure Works

**Habituation:**
With repeated, prolonged exposure, anxiety naturally decreases.

**Learning:**
We learn that the feared outcome doesn't happen, or that we can cope.

**Self-efficacy:**
We learn we're capable of facing difficult things.

### The Exposure Process

**Step 1: Create a Fear Hierarchy**
List avoided situations related to trauma and rate each (0-100 fear level).

*Example for car accident trauma:*
- Sitting in parked car (30)
- Being a passenger on quiet streets (40)
- Being a passenger on busy streets (55)
- Driving on quiet streets (60)
- Driving on busy streets (75)
- Driving on the freeway (85)
- Driving past the accident site (95)

**Step 2: Start with Manageable Items**
Begin with something that causes moderate anxiety (40-50), not the most feared item.

**Step 3: Stay Until Anxiety Decreases**
Remain in the situation until anxiety drops by at least half. This usually takes 30-90 minutes.

**Step 4: Repeat**
Practice repeatedly until the item no longer causes significant fear.

**Step 5: Move Up the Hierarchy**
Gradually work up to more challenging items.

### Types of Exposure

**In Vivo Exposure:**
Real-life exposure to feared situations.

**Imaginal Exposure:**
Vividly imagining the feared situation or memory.

**Interoceptive Exposure:**
Exposure to physical sensations of anxiety (heart racing, shortness of breath).

### Safety Notes

- Exposure for trauma should be done with professional guidance
- It's powerful and needs to be paced appropriately
- Work with a trained trauma therapist
- Ensure adequate coping skills are in place first

## Response Prevention

Often paired with exposure, response prevention involves resisting compulsive or avoidant behaviors.

**Examples:**
- Exposure to anxiety + not engaging in safety behaviors
- Facing a trigger + not using substances to cope
- Feeling an urge + not acting on it

**The Goal:**
Learn that you can tolerate discomfort without engaging in unhelpful behaviors.
